    <h1>Block and inline elements.</h1>
    <p>In html , we have two ways of breaking the text into multiple lines.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>the &lt;br&gt; empty element: </li>
        <li>the &lt;p&gt; non-empty element: </li>
    </ol>
    <p>So why do we have both of this? The Difference: </p>
    <p>&lt;br&gt; is just ending line! Html doesn't care how many line breaks we put in our page!</p>
    <p>But what &lt;p&gt; is doing is , it's creating a box around the content , it tells the browser to create a little invisible box around the text content. This box is called a <strong>block!</strong></p>
    <p>Blocks are heavily related to how the browser lays out text on the screen!</p>
    <p>This block has : </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Height</li>
        <li>Width</li>
        <li>Margin, Above and below it!</li>
    </ul>
    <p> This <em>Paragraph</em> element is what is called the <strong><mark>Block Element</mark></strong> , cuz it create this invisible box called <em>Block</em> around the text content! </p>
    <p>Elements that don't create <em>Block</em> are known as <strong>inline elements!</strong></p>
